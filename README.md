Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a first-year Artificial Intelligence student at Deggendorf Institute of Technology. As an aspiring software developer, I'm driven by my curiosity and love for solving complex problems.

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.languages = ["Kotlin", "Python", "Java", "C#"]
        self.tools = ["Visual Studio", "Git", "Jira", "AWS"]
        self.currently_learning = "Advanced Programming Concepts"

    def say_hello(self):
        return f"Hi there, I'm {self.name}! Welcome to my GitHub profile!"

me = Developer("Hlex")
print(me.say_hello())
```
